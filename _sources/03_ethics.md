# Submit your research ethics application

Conducting neuroimaging research, as with many forms of scientific inquiry involving human participants, requires approval from a research ethics committee. This ensures that your research procedures respect the rights, well-being, and dignity of participants. Submitting an ethics application is not just a procedural step, but a reflection of your commitment to conducting responsible and ethically sound research.

The application should provide a detailed account of your research aims, methodologies, data handling procedures, and potential risks to participants. Ensuring clarity and comprehensiveness in this submission will streamline the approval process and facilitate constructive feedback from the ethics committee.
