We make sure that the context is clear and ask ChatGPT to perform content analysis with deductive coding.

> **You**
> You are a helpful research assistant expert in content analysis for qualitative research. I have collected survey data and I am pasting here as a table in text format. 
> -- Here goes the table above -- 
> I want to perform deductive coding based on a code book: for question one the code book are the basic emotions words; for question two the code book is simply positive neutral negative to summarise the experience with the eye tracking device. Proceed with the deductive coding analysis. 

> **ChatGPT**
> Deductive coding involves applying a predefined set of codes to the data, which in this case includes basic emotion words for responses to the movie "Forrest Gump" and categorizing the experience with the eye-tracking device as positive, neutral, or negative. Let’s proceed with this coding method for the 10 synthetic subjects using the information provided earlier.
> 
> **Deductive Coding Process:**
> 
> 1.  **Review the Data:** Examine each participant’s responses to ensure understanding and proper application of the code book.
> 2.  **Apply the Codes:** Use the predetermined codes to classify each response.
> 3.  **Compile the Results:** Organize the codes into a table to show the distribution of emotional responses and experiences with the device.
> 
> **Deductive Coding Analysis:**
> 
> **Code Book for Question 1 (Emotions):** 
> *   **Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Anger**
> 
> **Code Book for Question 2 (Experience with Device):**
> *   **Positive, Neutral, Negative**
> 
> **Coding Results Table:**

| Name Surname | Basic Emotion Words from Q1 | Experience with Eye-Tracking Device (Q2) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John Doe | Sadness, Surprise | Neutral |
| Emily Stone | Happiness, Surprise | Neutral |
| Michael Rivera | Neutral | Neutral |
| Lisa Chang | Sadness, Happiness | Neutral |
| Alex Johnson | Surprise, Happiness | Neutral |
| Sarah Bennett | Sadness, Happiness | Neutral |
| Darren Smith | Neutral | Positive |
| Olivia Martinez | Sadness | Negative |
| Ethan Wright | Sadness, Happiness | Positive |
| Grace Kim | Happiness, Surprise | Neutral |

> **Explanation of Codes:**
> 
> 1.  **Basic Emotions Words for Q1:** Each response was reviewed for mentions or implications of basic emotions such as happiness (amusement, joy), sadness (sorrow, melancholy), surprise (shock, unexpected pleasure), etc. These emotions were coded according to the most prominent emotions expressed about the movie.  
> 2.  **Experience with the Eye-Tracking Device for Q2:** The overall sentiment expressed about the eye-tracking device was coded as:   
>    *   **Positive:** If the participant reported a beneficial or negligible impact on their viewing experience.
>    *   **Neutral:** If the participant noted some initial distractions or minor discomforts that did not majorly impact the viewing experience.
>    *   **Negative:** If the participant felt the device continuously interfered with or diminished the viewing experience.
> 
> **Conclusion:**
> 
> This table provides a structured view of how participants' responses align with the predefined codes based on their emotions and their experiences with the technology. This method of deductive coding helps in quickly identifying patterns and differences across responses based on the specified criteria, which is particularly useful in studies where the research questions and the theoretical framework are clearly defined in advance. This approach is less exploratory than inductive coding and focuses on testing existing theories or hypotheses.


We now want to produce some result tables to summarise the analysis. 

Rather than immediately asking to analyise the data, I first make sure that it knows what should be done

> **You**
> With the analysis the data was expanded into more columns. What is the best way to proceed after the deductive coding analysis?

> **ChatGPT**
> *...long output omitted, but basically it was a list of various options and then I picked one from the list...*

> **You**
> Compute a frequency analysis and cross tabulation

> **ChatGPT**
> To perform a frequency analysis and cross-tabulation based on the deductive coding results provided earlier, we first need to organize the coded data into a format suitable for analysis. The coding results are based on the basic emotion words for responses to "Forrest Gump" and the experience categories (positive, neutral, negative) for using the eye-tracking device.
> 
> ### Step 1: Frequency Analysis
> 
> We'll calculate the frequency of each category in both the emotional responses and the experiences with the eye-tracking device.
> 
> **Frequency of Basic Emotion Words (Question 1):**
> 
> *   **Happiness**
> *   **Sadness**
> *   **Surprise**
> *   **Neutral** (where no specific emotion was strongly indicated)
> 
> **Frequency of Experience with Eye-Tracking Device (Question 2):**
> 
> *   **Positive**
> *   **Neutral**
> *   **Negative**
> 
> Let's assume each participant expressed one predominant emotion for simplicity.
> 
> ### Step 2: Cross-Tabulation
> 
> Cross-tabulation will involve comparing the relationship between the types of emotional responses (basic emotions) and the experience with the eye-tracking device (positive, neutral, negative). This will help identify any patterns, such as whether a certain type of emotional reaction correlates with a specific experience with the technology.
> 
> ### Data Set Up and Computation
> 
> Based on the synthetic data provided in my previous messages, here is how we might structure and compute these analyses:
> 
> #### Frequency of Basic Emotion Words:
> 
> *   **Happiness:** 6
> *   **Sadness:** 6
> *   **Surprise:** 4
> *   **Neutral:** 2
> 
> #### Frequency of Experience with Device:
> 
> *   **Positive:** 2
> *   **Neutral:** 7
> *   **Negative:** 1
> 
> #### Cross-Tabulation Matrix Example:
> 

|  | Positive | Neutral | Negative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Happiness** | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| **Sadness** | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| **Surprise** | 0 | 4 | 0 |
| **Neutral** | 0 | 1 | 1 |


> #### Explanation:
> 
> This matrix shows how each type of emotional response correlates with each type of experience using the eye-tracking device. For example, participants who felt happiness predominantly had a neutral experience with the device.
> 
> #### Next Steps:
> 
> 1.  **Analysis Interpretation:** Interpret the cross-tabulation to understand the relationships between emotional responses and technological experiences. For example, whether sadder or happier participants felt more or less comfortable with the device.  
> 2.  **Statistical Testing:** Depending on the research question, you might apply statistical tests (like Chi-Square Test) to see if the distributions are statistically significant.  
> 3.  **Report Findings:** Summarize the findings in a report or presentation, highlighting the key correlations and their implications for the use of eye-tracking in emotional film viewing contexts.
>     
> 
> This structured approach to frequency analysis and cross-tabulation provides a clear way to understand the impact of the eye-tracking device on participants' movie-watching experiences, aligned with their emotional reactions.
