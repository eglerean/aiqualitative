# Planning: Pre-registration and data management plan

:::{note}
"Well planned, half done!" In this page some suggestions in how to put your plans and hypothesis into more formalised formats
:::

## Study plan, pre-registration, registered reports

The study plan is something that you have most likely written in the grant application stage. Some studies have clear hypotheses from the literature, while others might be more exploratory. Planning of your study can be more formalized using pre-registrations and/or registered reports.

### Pre-registration

A pre-registration is putting your ideas into written form and uploading the ideas into a pre-registration repository. Pre-registration is a step towards more robust, transparent, and reproducible research. It helps ensure that conclusions drawn from studies are based on the data and not on post hoc adjustments to fit desired narratives. 

The pre-registration can be as vague as a grant applications can be (e.g. there is no clear outline of the possible methodological choices) or they can be more formalized with clear list of hypotheses to be tested and detailed methodological choices. There are many advantages in pre-registering your study

#### Advantages of Pre-registering a Research Study

1. **Combatting P-Hacking and Cherry-Picking**: Pre-registration curtails the temptation to engage in "p-hacking" or cherry-pick results that align with desired outcomes. It commits researchers to a predefined analysis plan. [More on P-Hacking](https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700)

2. **Avoiding HARK-ing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)**: HARK-ing is when researchers present post-hoc hypotheses as if they were original predictions. Pre-registration clearly distinguishes between planned and exploratory hypotheses. [Reference: Kerr, N. L. (1998)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4)

3. **Increased Transparency**: By outlining the study's hypotheses, methods, and analyses beforehand, the research process becomes more transparent.

4. **Mitigating Publication Bias**: Pre-registration can help counteract the "file drawer problem." [More on Publication Bias](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912003/)

5. **Promotion of Reproducibility**: Pre-registration provides a detailed research blueprint, fostering reproducibility and verifiability.

6. **Protection from Memory Biases**: Pre-registration guards researchers against post-hoc alterations based on mistaken recollections.

7. **Ensuring Ethical Integrity**: Demonstrating commitment to transparent and honest reporting elevates the research's ethical stature.

8. **Clarifying Methodology**: Pre-registering promotes methodological rigor by encouraging researchers to detail their study design and methodologies.

9. **Maintaining a Public Record**: As a testament to a study's objectives, pre-registration differentiates between planned methodologies and those adjusted post hoc.

10. **Support for Unexpected Findings**: Novel findings gain more credibility in a pre-registered study context.

11. **Opportunity for Feedback**: Some pre-registration platforms or communities allow for feedback on registered plans, refining methodologies or hypotheses before the research starts.


## Registered reports

Registered reports are a more formal type of pre-registration where your hypotheses and methodological choices are peer-reviewed before data collection. This is the state of the art of doing science! A registered report is submitted to a journal as a manuscript that contains only the introduction and methods parts of your final paper. Peer reviewers will comment on the hypotheses and methods proposed to improve the protocol of the study. After the discussion, the registered report receives "In Principle Acceptance" i.e. the data collection and analysis protocols are accepted and the manuscript will be published in the journal, independently on the positive or null outcomes of the analyses. Please note that not all journals accept registered reports.

## Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)

PPI is best practice in medical studies: before conducting a study it is important to meet with the clinical population that is planned to be study and with public organisations that can give comments on the feasability of the research. Medical studies are not covered in this handbook since they usually do not happen at Aalto, however if your research involves a specific category of individuals, it can be beneficial to discuss the study hypotheses and design with them, before enbarking on the full project.
