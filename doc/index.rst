AI for Qualitative Analysis: A Practical Guide for Researchers
==============================================================

*A pocket size handbook for working with qualitative data and generative AI at Aalto University*

Author: Enrico Glerean

Coauthor: ...you! Get in touch to help writing this handbook.

This handbook offers a practical guide to the steps to conduct qualitative research powered by modern generative artificial intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs). Structured around key stages—from planning to data analysis and publication—this handbook is designed for those who are not familiar with AI, who are not coders or hackers or computer scientists, but would like to benefit of this new powerful technology. 

This handbook describes some examples of working with qualitative data and AI, but it does not force the researcher to follow each step rigorously. If your research workflow is slightly different than the one described here, please let us know so we can expand the documentation.
